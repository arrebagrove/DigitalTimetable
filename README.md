# Timetable viewing application for iOS/Android/Windows Phone

Well, I list all those platforms, but I'm only *actively* developing with Android in focus right now. This is due to the ease of access for emulation and development. Apple want me to have a Mac to give stuff to their users for free. Not sure about WP as I haven't looked into it yet (some bug with Xamarin means it doesn't show up), apologies to all eight users.

Don't worry, I've set up the project so cross-compatibility is not ruled out in the slightest down the road. I think. We'll see.

## I have a question...

I probably can't answer it. The project is still in very early, pre-usable stages as of now (14/10/16).
