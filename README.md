# Timetable viewing application for iOS/Android/Windows Phone

Well, I list all those platforms, but I'm only *actively* developing with Android in focus right now. This is due to the ease of access for emulation.

Don't worry, I've set up the project so iOS and other system compatibility is not ruled out in the slightest down the road. I think. We'll see.

# I have a question...

I probably can't answer it. The project is still in very early, pre-usable stages as of now (14/10/16).
